    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the implementation of a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The BMI is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. This calculator allows users to input their weight and height and receive their BMI value along with a classification based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculator follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Collection**: The program prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms and height in meters.\n",
    "2. **BMI Calculation**: The program calculates the BMI based on the user inputs.\n",
    "3. **Classification**: Based on the calculated BMI, the program classifies the result into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.\n",

    "## Code Implementation\n",

    "Below is the code for the BMI calculator:"
